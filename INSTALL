Installations of CKS
--------------------
WARNING: CKS is alpha software DO NOT RUN THE CKSD SERVER AS ROOT!

This is much harder than it has to be.  Basically, you need to do
allot of stuff by hand which I'll hopefully automake with 'make
install' before the final beta is released.

Compiling the programs: 
-----------------------
Put the IP and db info in the cks_config.c file or copy cks.conf
in the software archive into /usr/local/etc and edit that file.
run ./configure;make
(Do not run make install)

Setting up the database:
------------------------
You need to have postgresql installed in order to run cks.  While
cks will function with versions of postgres less that 7.2, I highly
recommend that you run with 7.2 because of the modifications that
where made to the way vacuum analyze works.

Make sure you have 2x as much free space on your disk as you have
used by your database.  You will need this for Write Ahead Logging
(WAL).

Getting Postgres Running:
You will need to connectly set up your hba.conf.

If you're running RedHat, you'll most likely want to 
add the following to your postgres start script in 
/etc/rc.d/init.d/postgresql:   -o '-i' 
which will cause postgresql to autostart in ip 
listenting mode. 

Steps to setting up the database:

change user to web server user in cks.sql
change your own user id if you'd like to do testing in cks.sql
create db called openpgp_keys and pguser named for your web server user
run cks.sql in psql

It is recommeded that you create an account called keyserver to 
run your keyserver and related cron jobs under.  This account 
will allow you to run your cks software in standard user space.

If you want to sink with a pks based network (horowitz protocol):
You can either point a mail alias from the pgp-keys account 
that pks expects, create a pgp-keys account to run the 
cks_mail_sync program under (add add appropriate account
creation and privliges in cks.sql), or you can provide the
email address of keyserver.  

Setting up the server:
---------------------
For the following programs:

CGI Programs:
add
search
cks_keyimg

Admin Programs:
delete
search
stats
sync_manage

CKS Programs:
cks_backup
cks_import
cks_mail_util
cks_mail_sync
cks_sync
cksd

To Install:

1. Rename the CGI Programs and the Admin Programs to append
   .cgi suffixes
2. Copy the contents of the html directory under your htdoc
   root
3. Copy CGI programs with execute permissions under html dir
   under htdoc root.
4. Copy Admin programs with execute permissions under html/admin
   dir under htdoc root.
5. Grant permissions from cks.sql to user who will run cksd
   server.
6. Run the cksd server program nohup.

If you have problems connecting to postgres, check to make
sure that you started postgres with the '-i' option to allow
network connections to the postmaster daemon.


Maintaining the Database:
-------------------------
You should run vacuum analyze on the tables every night via cron.


Setting up the Synchronization:
-------------------------------

out going syncs:

Contact vab@cryptnet.net for servers to sync with.  Then 
move cks_sync to the directory of an SQL authorized user.
Schedule it to run it cron and send out sync emails.  An
example cron sync entry is as follows:

5,10,15,20,25,30,35,40,45,50,55 * * * * /home/keyserver/bin/cks_mail_util

This will run the program once every five minutes.

incoming syncs:

Move cks_mail_sync to /home/keyserver/bin

create a .forward file with the contents: "|cks_mail_sync" and make
sure the perms on the forward file are 0700 (-rwx------).   

make a symlink in /etc/smrsh from /home/keyserver/bin/cks_mail_sync

tell people your sync address is keyserver@(your keyserver).

delete any messages that cause segfaults from your mailq every once
in a while and send them to me (vab@cryptnet.net) so that I can 
debug cks.  There aren't many messages any more that i've seen.
Don't leave these in the queue, they can throttle your cpu.

---
REMEMBER DO NOT RUN THE CKSD SERVER AS ROOT AND PATCH ANY VULNERABILITES
ON YOUR SYSTEM THAT COULD ALLOW A LOCAL SHELL TO ESCELATE PRIVS TO ROOT.

email vab@cryptnet.net for help with install or any questions.

P.S. DO NOT RUN THE CKSD SERVER AS ROOT.
