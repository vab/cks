<H3>About Synchronization</H3>

<P>Keyserver network synchronization is one of the more technically
challenging aspects of keyservers design and deployment.  In the
current version of the CryptNET keyserver, great effort has not been
made to solve this problem in an optimum way.  This version of the
keyserver simply uses sockets as it's preferred mechanism of
synchronization. Basically, the keyserver packets includes a program
which mimics a client submitting a key.

<H3>Current Synchronization Mechanisms</H3>

In this version of CKS, there are three programs that are responsible
for synchronization.  They are <B><i>cks_sync</i></B>, 
<B><I>cks_sync_manage</B></I>, and <B><i>cksd</i></B>.  These programs
work together to synchronize a CryptNET keyserver node with the CryptNET
keyserver network and to allow synchronization with pks based keyserver
networks.

When new key material is added to a keyserver, an entry is placed in
the cks_pending_sync table for that key.  The keyserver transmits
the full key info to its peers when the cks_sync program is run.
The peers to do not retransmit the material.  Keys which are added
by the cks_sync program do not generate records in the
<I>cks_pending_sync</I> table.  I currently make sure to provide new
CryptNET Keyserver Network node administrators with a full list of
servers in order to ensure that key material propagates fully and
properly.  The lack of a post secondary relaying mechanism prevents
infinite looping of key material synchronization.

<BR>
<P><B>cks_sync</B>
<P>This is the primary program responsible for synchronization.  This
program is meant to be run from a cron job.  I currently have the
program set up to run nightly, however it may be practical to run the
program hourly.  cks_sync queries the postgres server in order to
build a linked list of servers to synchronize with, and a list of
public keys which need to be synchronized.  cks_sync then walks the
lists of servers and keys transmitting the keys to instances of cksd
using the hkp protocol (http 1.0 cgi post).

<P>Keys which are to be synchronized are stored in the <I>cks_pending_sync</I>
table by their fingerprint.  The list of servers to synchronize with
is stored in the <I>cks_other_servers</I> table.  The field
<I>sync_priority</I> allows a priority to be set for each server. When
cks_sync pulls the server list, it sorts the results by the priority
field.

<BR>
<P><B>cks_sync_manage</B>
<P>cks_sync_manage is a self explanatory program used to manage the
records in the <I>cks_other_servers</I> table.

<BR>
<P><B>cksd</B>
<P>cksd is the main daemon responsible for keyservice.  The only role
that cksd plays in synchronization is through the reception and storage
of key transmissions from cks_sync.

<H3>Notes about key deletion as it relates to synchronization</H3>
<P>CKS is a novel keyserver platform in that it allows keys to be
specified as rejected.  A rejected key cannot be added to the database.
Keys can only be given rejected status by the keyserver node administrator
through the <B><I>delete.cgi</I></B> program.  The mechanism of action
behind this is the storage of the rejected key's fingerprint is a database
table called <I>cks_rejected_keys</I>.  If a synchronization addition of a
rejected key is attempted, the key will not be added to the database.

<P>CKS is currently not capable of synchronizing key rejection status across
different keyserver nodes due to the authentication and security requirements
of such a mechanism.  This feature will likely be available in the near
future (post 1.0.0) as this is not a terribly difficult problem.
