<H3>Database Design</H3>

<P>The fingerprint of the public key is the primary key in almost all
of the database tables.  The exception is the UID table since there
can clearly be many UIDs per public key.  While the fingerprint is
not guaranteed to be unique, a fingerprint collision is sufficiently
unlikely to require an alternative primary key strategy.  When the
use of the full fingerprint is not ideal, the full keyid (in the case
of openPGP version 4 keys) is used.  I have attempted to avoid using
the keyid as at least one collision is already known to exist in the
keyring.

<P>There is a great deal of duplication of key information in the database
in the interest of query and key retrieval speed.  Originally, I had
considered breaking the key material into packets and storing individual
packets in database tables thereby eliminating almost all data duplication.
However, this proved to be very inefficient.  It was very labor intensive
to retrieve all of the packets, reassemble them correctly, fingerprint
them, radix encode them, checksum them, and finally format them into an
ASCII armored public key for client download.  A much more optimized
solution was necessary.

<P>I have found the best database design to include the storage of the
full radix encoded data, the radix checksum, and all of the associated
user and key ids.  This allows me to have keyid, full keyid, fingerprint,
and uids available for querying against without doing and packet
processing for hashing.  It also allows the very rapid construction of
the ASCII public for the client through the concatenation of the stored
radix encoded data, the radix checksum, and the header information
in the cks_config struct datastructure.  The additional storage
requirements are not great due to the fact that most of the duplicated
data is hashes which are not truly duplicated by really pre-generated
and flags about the key.

<P>The most critical factor of the design which allows for a great
performace improvements of the traditional keyring method or a
relationalized traditional keyring storage method is that I can
provide the summary results of queries which return more than one
key with out processing any key information.  This total reliance
on the RDBMS is clearly beneficial.  Another great benefit of the
design is the ability to do joins based on directly equated full
keyid, and keyid.  This allows me to provide a UID for a signing
keyid through a single query which allows sub 1 second result
times on a fast system with keys with as many as 20 signatures.

<P>The only future expansion I see a need for in the near future is the
addition of a table, or group of tables, to support subkey id and
information storage and querying.

<P>A possible future optimization of the database was the suggestion
of John Goerzen to store keyids, full keyids, and possibly fingerprints
as integers rather than char format hex representations.  I'm still
considering the implications of this on the other code and the
performance and storage gains which would result.

<H3>Database Access Programs</H3>

<P>Eventually all of the cgi programs will be folded into the cksd daemon
(version 2.0.0 or 3.0.0). Since pthreads support has not yet been
implemented there is limited benefit to the use of a monolithic daemon.
In the short term, the cgi programs have been made available.  The cgi
programs make development and debugging easier.
